public class ArgumentVsParameter {
    //Argument: Actual value passed to the function
    //Example: (Red is the argument)
    //changePaintColor("Red")

    //Parameter: A variable in a method definition
    //Example: (color is the Parameter)
    //public static void changePaintColor(String color)

    //When a method is called, the parameters get the value of the arguments that were passed to the function

    // Call by value --> Call by value
    //Call by reference -> A function receives a reference to each argument, and can modify them

    //Java uses call by value, so the original arguments of a function are never modified
