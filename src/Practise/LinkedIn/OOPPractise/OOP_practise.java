    Encapsulation - wrapping data and methods
    With encapsulation, the variables and data of a given class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through specific methods of its own class.

    //Functional programming focuses on computing results from functions rather than performing actions on objects. Objects in a functional programming language are often immutable and instead of changing an object, you create a new object which looks like the


//The keyword super sets up the immediate parent class.

//Object-oriented programming organizes your program around objects rather than _____, and data rather than _____. (actions, data)

//Lambda:
Lambdas are anonymous functions that you can create easily in Java without the usual code overhead of public static void etc. It is a great tool if you just need a quick function for a calculation in your code.

//Interfaces:
Interfaces are a way to enforce certain fields or methods on a class. The interface does not enforce exactly how these methods should be implemented, but only that a particular class must have these fields and methods.
