Task02:
    Create a class called Circle
            instance variables:
                    radius, pi, diameter
            add a constructor that can initialize the radius of the circle
            instance methods:
                    area(): can return the area of the circle as double
                    perimeter(): cna return the perimeter of the circle as double
                    toString(): returns the info of the circle
            Note: global value of PI is 3.14
                  diameter of circle = 2 * radius
                  area of circle = PI * r * r
