OOP PRINCIPLES:
    •Encapsulation
    •Inheritance
    •Abstraction
    •Polymorphism
Object-oriented:  Everything is considered to be an “object” which possess some state,
behavior and all the operations are performed using these objects.
Encapsulation: Data Hiding
     •An object hides its internal data from code that is outside the class that the object is an instance of.
     •Only the current class’s methods can directly access and make changes to the instance variables
     •You hide an instance variable by giving private access modifier,  and making the methods that access those fields public.
     •These public methods are called getters and setters (accessor and mutator)
   1. hide the data by giving 'private' access modifier
   2. grant other classes access to use the 'private' data through getter and setter (public methods)
 •We can provide only getter in a class to make the variable immutable. (Read only)
 •We can provide only setter in a class to make the class attribute. (write-only)

public class Encapsulation {

    // private: only accessible in class :
    private long SSN;
    // private : NO DIRECT ACCESS to this variable from any other class
    // to encapsulate this private ins variable ==> generate getter and setter
    // getter (read-only): has to be public
    // (if default: we won't be able to use it in another package even if we import this class)
    // give long return type: Return Type must match with private instance variable data type
    // then name : preferred getVariableName


    //getter: read only
    public long getSSN(){
        return SSN;
    }

    // can I call it somewhere else? Yes - public access modifier
    // when I call this method ==> I'll be able to get to my variable
    // we are only returning here = we are not initializing any value to SSN

    //setter: write only

    // we need the SETTER to modify the value of the private data we have
    // setter (write-only):  must be public -
    // (if default: we won't be able to use it in another package even if we import this class)
    // void return type : I'm only setting the value ,
    // I'm not returning anything
    // must pass a parameter to set the value of the private instance variable
    // parameter data type MUST match with private instance variable
    // name = preferred setVariableName
    // the function of setter is to initialize value to the variable ==> pass parameter to be assigned
    // the parameter has to have same dataType (long here). We can give it same name of instance variable and use this. to initialize

    public void setSSN(long SSN) { // write-only method (Always void return type)
        // now I will initialize the value I'm passing to the private ins var:

        //every time when we call setter, we have to pass argument = matching dataType
        // if the setter we created here is an instance method ==> can I call it using the object?
        // Yes I can call it using the object (and pass the parameter ) in Test Class
